    <main>This is a start to my journey in programming/coding<p>(what's the difference? I don't know yet, maybe they're synonymous).</p></main><br>

    <p>I want to start my adventure on the <em><strong> "thrilling" </strong></em>world of programming(or <font color="red">"torture"</font> as many seem to refer to it as), as i strive to become an indie developer for apps, websites, video games and more!</p>

    <p>While i may be new to the concept, I will strive to reach my goal starting today, <font color="blue">September 18th, 2024</font> </p>

    <p> here is a picture of the famous "Hatsune Miku", thank you for your time.</p>
